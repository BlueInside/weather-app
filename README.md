# Weather App

This is a simple weather app built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The app allows users to search for the weather forecast of a specific location by entering the city name.

## Introduction <a id='introduction'></a>

The Weather App is a project I developed to practice my skills in asynchronous programming with JavaScript. It uses a weather API to fetch real-time weather data for a given city and display the forecast to the user.

## Technologies <a id='technologies'></a>

The app is built using the following technologies:

- JavaScript: To handle the logic and interactions.
- HTML: To structure the layout and content.
- CSS: To style the user interface.
- Webpack: To bundle the JavaScript modules.
- Babel: To transpile modern JavaScript code for better browser compatibility.
- ESLint: To ensure code quality and maintain consistent coding standards.

## Features <a id='features'></a>

- Search for weather forecasts of different cities.
- Display current weather information, such as temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed.
- Show weather forecast for the next few days.

## What I Learned <a id='whatLearned'></a>

During the development of this weather app, I learned and applied the following concepts:

- Asynchronous programming using Promises: I used Promises to handle API calls and asynchronous data fetching, allowing for more organized and manageable code.
- Working with modern JavaScript syntax: I used ES6 features such as arrow functions, template literals, and destructuring assignment to write cleaner and more concise code.
- Handling API requests and responses: I learned how to make HTTP requests to an external API and process the responses to extract the relevant data.
- Webpack and Babel setup: I configured Webpack with Babel to transpile my modern JavaScript code, ensuring compatibility with older browsers.
- Code quality and linting: I integrated ESLint into my development workflow to catch potential errors and enforce consistent coding standards.

## Acknowledgements

- I would like to express my gratitude to the developers and maintainers of the weather API I used in this project. Their API provided valuable data for the weather forecasts, making this project possible.
